# steelers-quiz-app

This is my first project I am submitting to my portfolio and it brings together everything I have learned so far. It relies
heavily on jQuery functions to move users through the quiz app while logging their correct score and current question. Users
also are given feedback after every answer and are given a summary total of how they did at the end with an option to retake.

The technologies I used to put this quiz app together was basic HTML for structure, CSS for styling and responsiveness and 
JS to get the functionality of the quiz to work. My biggest challenge on this project was related to CSS layout issues which 
took much longer than expected. Overall, I learned a lot from this project and defintely enjoyed it.
